**Title:** I used AI to build an Android app for tracking my PR status (Open Source) 🇨🇦

**Body:**

Hi everyone! 👋

I'm not a professional developer, just a tech geek who likes playing around with AI tools. Like many of you, I've been checking the IRCC tracker constantly and wanted a better way to see my updates on my phone.

So, I asked an AI to help me build an Android app for it, and the result is actually pretty cool!

It’s called **MyCanada Tracker**. I built it for myself to have a nice dashboard and widgets, but I thought I'd share it here in case it helps anyone else waiting for that golden email.

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
*   **Unofficial**: This is just a personal hobby project. It is **NOT** affiliated with IRCC.
*   **Use at your own risk**: It works great for me, but since I'm just figuring this out as I go, I can't guarantee it will work forever.
*   **Tested on PR**: I built this for my **Permanent Residence** application. It might work for other types, but I haven't tested them.
*   **Privacy**: The app runs locally on your phone. I don't see or store any of your data.

### ✨ Features
*   **Clean Dashboard**: Much easier to read than the mobile site.
*   **Home Screen Widget**: See your status without opening the app.
*   **AI Explanations**: You can even use your own Gemini API key to get AI explanations of what the status updates mean.
*   **Offline Support**: View your last update even without signal.

### 📥 Download
It's free and open source on GitHub. You can download the APK or even look at the code if you want to see how the AI wrote it!
